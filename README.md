CKEditor 5 with File Manager build
==================================

This repository contains a build for CKEditor 5 with all the features needed for managing your media. This is done by including a [free file manager](https://flmngr.com) as a plugin in the build. 

Flmngr file manager allows you to upload, manage and insert images into your content. It also has ImgPen Image Editor built into it.

You will store all the files and image on your own server and have full control over them. A simple [PHP script](https://packagist.org/packages/edsdk/flmngr-server-php) is included for that.

## Install

See [the installation guide](https://flmngr.com/doc/install-ckeditor-5-with-file-manager-build) describing using this build.

Then after you started using it, please [install the PHP backend](https://flmngr.com/doc/install-php-file-manager-composer) to switch from the default demo file server to your one where you host a website or an app.
